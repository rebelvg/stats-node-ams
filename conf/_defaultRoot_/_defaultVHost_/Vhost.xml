	<!-- This section specifies virtual directory mappings for resources -->

		<!-- This maps all streams whose virtual			 -->

		<!-- names begin with "foo/" to the physical directory c:\data.  -->
		<!-- For example, the stream named "foo/bar" would map to the    -->

		<!-- stream named "foo/bar/x", then we first try to find a vdir  -->
